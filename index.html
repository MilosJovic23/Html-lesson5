					The terms "mushroom" and "toadstool" go back centuries <br />
					and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus <br />
					on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the <br />
					terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron,<br />
					or musserouns were used.
